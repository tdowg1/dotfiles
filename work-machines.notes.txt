* start with ARINC dotfiles
** COMPLETE merge in content saved in db, etc.
** fix any known issues
*** suggestions for howto possibly fix whawtever is the freaking problem with/or around the clearcase function guys... (dotfiles/work-machines/walrus/.dotfiles/functions.sh)
**** check that it's ok to have the `return' statement in a bash function, like I have it in a lot of the clearcase functions
**** check that the usage of "*"'s is ok
**** check that all of the bash syntax is correct
***** parens, curly braces, and quotes are balanced
***** run it through a bash cmdln syntax check
***** run it through bash "debugger"
***** open it in various IDE's/editors
***** run back through ALL of the revision history changes... trying to reproduce the bad behaviour.
**** specfic lines should focus on
***** search for 'if [[ -d "${x}" || -f "${x}" ]] ; then' because I dont think that's valid syntax... if its the OR operation you want, that's accomplished via '-o', like  '	if [[ -d "${x}" -o -f "${x}" ]] ; then'

* then merge in current dotfiles on magnificent machine (which is a descendent version of ARINC-created dotfiles)
