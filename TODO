== BUGS ==
* home-machines/.functions.sh has /some/ kind of weird bash syntax error (but
not exactly because `bash -n .functions.sh' says its ok).  It is located
I think around the clearcase ish.  Investigate.
** I verfied this because I'm doing some totally unrelated shell scripting 
shtuff and like all my functions were being printed to stdout.  Removing any
and all of those clearcase functions I wrote a while ago, stopped this
odd printing of functions to stdout.
** STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
**# write a dummy script that just sets a variable or soemthing
**# call dummy script like `bash -vx dummy.sh'
**# notice all the extra crap is is dumped out


== ENHANCEMENTS ==
=== dotfiles.sh ===
* all for single file operations, currently, its all or nothing


== NOTES ==

== MISC ==
=== misc TODO ===
* rename "home-machines" something else; is incorrect.
** rename ideas
*** curr
*** active
** here's a totally diff approach
*** move all content currently in "home-machines" into root.
*** split out the "apps" folder (would need some way of making/getting updates to the dotfiles.sh syncer script tho...; perhaps git submodules?).
*** move all those archive/whatever folders into root as well, but name the folder like ".historical" ".archives" or something stupid, which i dont even know why i need since this is revision control but Im just a stupid human I guess.
