== BUGS ==
* home-machines/.functions.sh has /some/ kind of weird bash syntax error (but
not exactly because `bash -n .functions.sh' says its ok).  It is located
I think around the clearcase ish.  Investigate.
** I verfied this because I'm doing some totally unrelated shell scripting 
shtuff and like all my functions were being printed to stdout.  Removing any
and all of those clearcase functions I wrote a while ago, stopped this
odd printing of functions to stdout.
** STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
**# write a dummy script that just sets a variable or soemthing
**# call dummy script like `bash -vx dummy.sh'
**# notice all the extra crap is is dumped out


== ENHANCEMENTS ==
=== dotfiles.sh ===
* all for single file operations, currently, its all or nothing
