== BUGS ==
* home-machines/.functions.sh has /some/ kind of weird bash syntax error (but
not exactly because `bash -n .functions.sh' says its ok).  It is located
I'm sure around the clearcase ish.  Investigate.
** I verfied this because I'm doing some totally unrelated shell scripting 
shtuff and like all my functions were being printed to stdout.  Removing any
and all of those clearcase functions I wrote a while ago, stopped this
odd printing of functions to stdout.


== ENHANCEMENTS ==
=== dotfiles.sh ===
* all for single file operations, currently, its all or nothing


== NOTES ==

== MISC ==
