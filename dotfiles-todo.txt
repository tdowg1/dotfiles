COMPLETE figure out wtf is up with that fucking vundle sub repo
COMPLETE deal with git stashies within primary dotfiles repo on shazam...

deal with changes made to dotfiles on bump



NEW non-repo fixup'ing SHIT::

deal with "dotfiles--to-add" text file on newjack

dotfiles under webserver path files/linux/*

when in a git working copy, on shazam, i get a nice supporting bash prompt...
* but on newjack i dont. whats the settings for that?
* after figuring it out on newjack, try to reproduce on bump (im not optimistic itll work there though)
* lol and weirdly, this looks better on newjack than shazam (the branch text is colored blue):
    [ teelah@newjack ~/dotfiles/home-machines ]$ bra -v
    * master 06bdcc7 [origin/master] misc dotfile changes (shazam)
    [ bdavies@shazam ~/dotfiles-merging/home-machines (master $=) ]$ bra -v
    * master 06bdcc7 [origin/master] misc dotfile changes (shazam)



change terminal prompt colors (vibv) for newjack...
