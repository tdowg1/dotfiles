deal with changes made to dotfiles on bump



NEW non-repo fixup'ing ::

deal with "dotfiles--to-add" text file on newjack

dotfiles under webserver path files/linux/*

when in a git working copy, on shazam, i get a nice supporting bash prompt...
* but on newjack i dont. whats the settings for that?
* after figuring it out on newjack, try to reproduce on bump (im not optimistic itll work there though)
* lol and weirdly, this looks better on newjack than shazam (the branch text is colored blue):
    [ teelah@newjack ~/dotfiles/home-machines ]$ bra -v
    * master 06bdcc7 [origin/master] misc dotfile changes (shazam)
    [ bdavies@shazam ~/dotfiles-merging/home-machines (master $=) ]$ bra -v
    * master 06bdcc7 [origin/master] misc dotfile changes (shazam)



change terminal prompt colors (vibv) for...
* <color ideas>: that bright green on like default mint
* newjack:
* bump: silvery, brand colors
* phi: purpley
* intel: bluey
* ipoowid:
