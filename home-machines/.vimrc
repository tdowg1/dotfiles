" 2019-05-11: following write up at : https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/
" this makes code folding work the way youd expect it to:
Plugin 'tmhedberg/SimpylFold'

" The best plugin for Python auto-complete is YouCompleteMe:
Bundle 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'
" ^^^Under the hood, YouCompleteMe uses a few different auto-completers
" (including Jedi for Python), and it needs some C libraries to be installed
" for it to work correctly. The docs have very good installation instructions:
"    https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#mac-os-x-super-quick-installation
" so be sure you follow them.
"    for most of my machines, this should work:
"       sudo apt install build-essential cmake python3-dev
"       cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
"       python3 install.py --clang-completer


" The first line ensures that the auto-complete window goes away when youâ€™re
" done with it, and the second defines a shortcut for goto definition.
let g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_completion=1
map <leader>g  :YcmCompleter GoToDefinitionElseDeclaration<CR>


" One issue with the goto definition above is that VIM, by default, doesnt
" know anything about virtualenv, so you have to make VIM and YouCompleteMe
" aware of your virtualenv by adding the following lines of code to .vimrc:

" python with virtualenv support
py3 << EOF
import os
import sys
if 'VIRTUAL_ENV' in os.environ:
  project_base_dir = os.environ['VIRTUAL_ENV']
  activate_this = os.path.join(project_base_dir, 'bin/activate_this.py')
  execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this))
EOF

" ^^^This determines if you are running inside a virtualenv, switches to
" that specific virtualenv, and then sets up your system path so that
" YouCompleteMe will find the appropriate site packages.


" You can have VIM check your syntax on each save with the syntastic
" extension:
Plugin 'vim-syntastic/syntastic'

" Also add PEP 8 checking with this nifty little plugin:
Plugin 'nvie/vim-flake8'


let python_highlight_all=1



" Color schemes work in conjunction with the basic color scheme that you are
" using. Check out solarized for GUI mode, and Zenburn for terminal mode:
Plugin 'jnurmine/Zenburn'
Plugin 'altercation/vim-colors-solarized'

" Then, just add a bit of logic to define which scheme to use based upon the
" VIM mode:
if has('gui_running')
  set background=dark
  colorscheme solarized
else
  colorscheme zenburn
endif


" Solarized also ships with a dark and light theme. To make switching between
call togglebg#map("<F5>")   " them very easy with F5


" If you want a proper file tree, then NERDTree is the way to go:
Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree'  " :NERDTree [startdirectory | bookmark]
" https://www.pkimber.net/howto/vim/plugin/nerd-tree.html
map <F2> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>


" If you want to use tabs, utilize vim-nerdtree-tabs:
Plugin 'jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs'

" Want to hide .pyc files? Then add the following line:
let NERDTreeIgnore=['\.pyc$', '\~$']   " ignore files in NERDTree



" Want to search for basically anything from VIM? Check out ctrlP:  (initiate
" with c-p, duh)::
Plugin 'kien/ctrlp.vim'
" ^^^See it in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XrHk3xjYsw


" Want to perform basic git commands without leaving the comfort of VIM? Then
" vim-fugitive is the way to go:
Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
" ^^^See it in action on VIMcasts:
" http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim---a-complement-to-command-line-git/


" Powerline is a status bar that displays things like the current virtualenv,
" git branch, files being edited, and much more.  Its written in Python, and
" it supports a number of other environments like zsh, bash, tmux, and
" IPython:
"Plugin 'Lokaltog/powerline', {'rtp': 'powerline/bindings/vim/'}
" ^^^Take a look at the official docs for all the configuration options.

" Vim usually has its own clipboard and ignores the system keyboards, but
" sometimes you might want to cut, copy, and/or paste to/from other
" applications outside of VIM. On OS X, you can access your system clipboard
" with this line:
