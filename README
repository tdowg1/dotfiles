This repo contains a collection of personal Linux configuration files, aka
/dotfiles/.

This repo also contains an apps directory
(https://github.com/tdowg1/dotfiles/tree/master/apps/) that stores a few of my
more futile attempts at "easily" keeping my dotfiles synchronized.  Currently,
there are 2 apps and then are quite different from one another.  For instance,
mvin-HTTP (https://github.com/tdowg1/dotfiles/tree/master/apps/mvin-HTTP)
depends on a previously configured webserver that's setup to receive content.
The use-case for this (quite buggy) app was to allow for dotfile
synchronization even if you're in an environment where the super awesome
network administrators block just about every port except for 80.  Alas,
nowadays I just use github :)
